Task 1: Connect to linux
ssh -i file.pem user@ipaddress
yes if prompted

Task 2: Using the tee command
hostname | tee file1.txt
confirm file was created with ls

Task 3: Use sort command and pipe operator
cat > test.csv
    Factory, 1, Paris
    Store, 2, Dubai
    Factory, 3, Brasilia
    Store, 4, Algiers
    Factory, 5, Tokyo
ctr+d - exit edit mode
ls - confirm file was created
sort test.csv
find | grep Paris test.csv

Task 4: Use the cut command
cat > cities.csv
    Dallas, Texas
    Seattle, Washington
    Los Angeles, California
    Atlante, Georgia
    New York, New York
ctr+D - exit edit mode
ls - validate the file was created
cut -d ',' -f 1 cities.csv - should result in showing everything before , on each line

Additional Challenge: Use sed command to change all , to .
sed 's/,/./g' cities.csv
